"""
MongoEngine EmbeddedDocument representing a single reservation (booking).

This model is designed to be embedded inside a parent document (e.g., Cage).
Storing bookings as embedded documents keeps booking data co-located with the
parent for efficient reads when accessing a cage and its reservations together.

"""
A single reservation made by an owner for a specific snake.

    Fields:
        guest_owner_id: ObjectId of the user/owner who made the booking.
        guest_snake_id: ObjectId of the snake being boarded.

        booked_date: When this booking record was created (optional).
        check_in_date: Start date/time of the stay (required).
        check_out_date: End date/time of the stay (required).

        review: Free-form text feedback left by the owner (optional).
        rating: Numeric rating for the stay (default 0). Define a convention
                (e.g., 0â€“5) at the application level.

    Notes:
    - ObjectIdField is used instead of ReferenceField because this document
        is embedded; storing raw ObjectIds avoids cross-collection references
        and simplifies the embedded schema.
    - Ensure that check_in_date and check_out_date use consistent timezone
        handling (both naive or both aware) to avoid arithmetic issues.
